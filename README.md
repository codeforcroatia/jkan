# JKAN [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/timwis/jkan.svg?branch=gh-pages)](https://travis-ci.org/timwis/jkan) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/timwis/jkan](https://badges.gitter.im/timwis/jkan.svg)](https://gitter.im/timwis/jkan?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
A lightweight, backend-free open data portal, powered by Jekyll

Open-source data portals can be really hard to install and maintain. But their
basic purpose of providing links to download data really isn't that complicated. JKAN is a proof-of-concept
that allows a small, resource-strapped government agency to stand-up an open data portal by simply
[clicking the fork button](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

Please note this is still a work in progress! Check out the [issues](https://github.com/timwis/jkan/issues) to help
